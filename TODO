* Add exception handling to SQLActor, esp connect()
* Handle relative to absolute paths correctly for, e.g. generating email links?
  --> See: https://github.com/monkeysuffrage/phpuri
* Make Javascript hide/set/disable certain fields depending on user-type in apply.php


* Alter User Profile data to just request a full name and a preferred term of address
* Make UserProfile and ProjectRequest classes able to complete the submission process - RequestPair should probably be obsolete


* HMMMM. You could split up the user profile application and the project request bit now, like you always kind of thought would happen.
* Into separate pages, I mean.
* Then if someone loads up the project request page without having filled in a profile, all the elements are disabled.
* Yesssssssss.


* Correct all function and variable and property names according to new names to make sense O_o

* Make database operations within transactions to allow catch and rollback

* Take a look at PHPUnit's DbUnit section to actually allow you to unit test: http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/database.html
