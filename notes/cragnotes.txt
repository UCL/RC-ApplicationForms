### Misc Form Notes

Warn users that they will need to provide funding information when they renew.

Remind users that they should add the acknowledgement string to papers.


### User Types

If you're a PI, a lecturer, or an undergrad, you can be either funded or unfunded.

If you're a postgrad or a postdoc, you must be funded.

(If a person is a PI of one project and a researcher in another project, they could be both unfunded and funded.)


### Projects

Once you have a valid project, you'll get access -- but you need the ability to collect information about a new project at renewal and then submit that project for approval. Presumably renewals of old, already approved projects don't need to be approved.

Information collected should be just:

 * project research aims
 * expected technical resources and methods required (inc software, job information if known)

Projects must be able to expire, and should expire when a new one is applied for.


### Renewal

Funding information taken retrospectively, not when applying initially.

Publication information collected.

Collaboration information collected.

### Services

Everyone is approved for access to everything.

Pending technical assessment? Not clear.

once you have one valid project, you get access -- don't need more than one project aims set per user

research outcomes taken per year

later service requests only require technical assessment

{
nature of the project

types of work just requested rather than service wanted -- with explanation?
also technical explanation of what they're doing, software, computational resources, etc

separate boxes
}

everyone to have access to everything D:

registration is separate but everyone is *pre-approved* for everything


Capture collaboration information at renewal (since often people don't know in advance)

If someone has a new project, they need to apply with project information again
