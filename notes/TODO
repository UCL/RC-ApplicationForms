* Add exception handling to SQLActor, esp connect()
* Handle relative to absolute paths correctly for, e.g. generating email links?
  --> See: https://github.com/monkeysuffrage/phpuri
* Make Javascript hide/set/disable certain fields depending on user-type in apply.php


* Alter User Profile data to just request a full name and a preferred term of address

* Take a look at PHPUnit's DbUnit section to actually allow you to unit test: http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/database.html


//TODO: Text generator in ProjectRequest for work reqs and collab details
