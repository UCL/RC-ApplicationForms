Renewals to happen a year from application no matter when the application was made, rather than all renewals happening on the same date.

People seem fine with the idea that only a supervisor has to approve, or else some other permanent staff sponsor.

Must approve both at application and renewal.

Research theme given at both application and renewal.

Also all supervisors have to be members of permanent academic staff by UCL rules.


Research themes based initially on EPSRC and other funding bodies.

 * Arts and Humanities Research Council
 * Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council
 * Economic and Social Research Council
 * Medical Research Council
 * Natural Environment Research Council
 * Science and Technology Facilities Council

Consortium Leaders become CRAG advisors

Research theme mailing lists?

Within UCL, successful applications would be public

Users need ability to change PI/supervisor at renewal (in case the supervisor leaves)

Should add link to exemplar application to avoid one-line application text.
